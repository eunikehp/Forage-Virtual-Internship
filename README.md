# Forage-Virtual-Internship

Forage is an open access platform designed to unlock exciting careers by connecting students with company-endorsed Virtual Work Experience Programs.

Virtual Work Experience Programs are online programs built and endorsed by leading companies. These programs contain a series of resources and tasks designed to simulate the real-world experience of starting a career.
